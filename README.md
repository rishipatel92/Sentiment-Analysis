# Sentiment Analysis with Web Scraping and NLTK

# Introduction:
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my self-made Sentiment Analysis project! ðŸ“Š In this endeavor, I harnessed the power of web scraping, utilizing Selenium and Beautiful Soup, to extract text from various sites. The project then delves into sentiment analysis, employing NLTK libraries to gain insights into the sentiment conveyed by the extracted text.




# Project Workflow:
1. Web Scraping: Selenium and Beautiful Soup were employed to navigate websites and extract relevant text data. The extraction process ensures a diverse dataset for sentiment analysis.

2. Sentiment Analysis: The heart of the project lies in the sentiment analysis phase. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) libraries are utilized to process the text data and derive sentiment scores. This step provides a deeper understanding of the emotional tone present in the extracted content.
